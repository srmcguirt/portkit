//! Postgres introspection via `pg_catalog`.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Vendored from `magna-introspect` (github.com/fellwork/magna), commit
//! `8519d710ee50cfee0ff69fe48b85d6c0297a12ce`, 2026-04-26. Same author, same
//! MIT OR Apache-2.0 terms.
//!
//! Copied rather than depended on because magna is a `publish = false`
//! workspace in another repository: a path dependency would make portkit
//! unbuildable for anyone else. Its declared `magna-types` dependency was
//! unused and has been dropped.
//!
//! Re-sync by diffing against that path in magna and updating the commit above.
